## Description
>I wrote you a song. Put it in the picoCTF{} flag format.

## Solution
At first it looked like strange and very difficult task, but hint reminded me that there is a programming language called `rockstar`. So i found online interpreter of it and ran program which is the `lyrics.txt` file attached to the challenge.

Program output was:
>114\
114\
114\
111\
99\
107\
110\
114\
110\
48\
49\
49\
51\
114

Now it looked like ASCII codes.

After converting those numbers into text, I got: rrrocknrn0113r.

And that was the flag(which still had to be put inside picoCTF{})

Flag:
>picoCTF{rrrocknrn0113r}
