## Description
>Can you invoke help flags for a tool or binary? This program has extraordinarily helpful information...

## Solution

Running program results in displaying this information:
>$./warm \
Hello user! Pass me a -h to learn what I can do!

So natural is trying
>$./warm -h

And this results in:
>Oh, help? I actually don't do much, but I do have this flag here: picoCTF{b1scu1ts_4nd_gr4vy_616f7182}

And that's all
