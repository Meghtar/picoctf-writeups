# Scavenger Hunt

Points: 50

## Category

Web Exploitation

## Description
>There is some interesting information hidden around this site http://mercury.picoctf.net:xxxx/. Can you find it?

## Solution
Similar to `Insp3ct0r` but more complex challenge.

First part of flag is in source of main page:
```
	<!-- Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t -->
```

Second is easily found inside css file:
```
/* CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0 */
```

This time in js file there is only a hint:
```
/* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */
```

Which gives a tip to look inside `robots.txt` file:
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /index.html
# Part 3: t_0f_pl4c
# I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?
```

Another hint gives a clue about apache server (and Access is written by capital 'A' ;))

That made me think about .htaccess file, which contained next part:
```
# Part 4: 3s_2_lO0k
# I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.
```

Here are 2 keywords: `Mac` and `Store`, on Mac OS there are special files named `.DS_Store` and that's the final part:
```
Congrats! You completed the scavenger hunt. Part 5: _35844447}
``` 

Now i just had to merge parts of the flag and task is done!

Flag:
>picoCTF{th4ts_4_l0t_0f_pl4c3s_2_lO0k_35844447}
