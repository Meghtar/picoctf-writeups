>Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. http://mercury.picoctf.net:xxxxx/

## Solution
On website there is a textbox. After putting some gibberish into it, there appears a cookie 'name' with value -1. I tried setting the value to different numbers and refreshing website (which of course could be automated). After that, some example numbers like 1 -> 5 resulted in displaying texts like `I love chocolate chip cookies!` or `I love gingersnap cookies!`, so depending on cookie value, the text was different.

Finally after setting cookie value to 18, a flag appears!
