Web Exploitation

## Description
>Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/xxxxx/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:xxxxx

## Solution
As name says, whole challenge is only about inspecting source of the website.

First part of flag is inside source of main page:

```
<!-- Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3 -->
```

Second part is hidden inside css file:

```
/* You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t */
```

Last part is inside js file:

```
/* Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: _lucky?f10be399} */
```

Last thing to do is to just join the parts and flag is ready.

Flag:
>picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?f10be399}
