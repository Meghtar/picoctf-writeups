## Description
>What does this `bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1` mean? I think it has something to do with bases.

## Solution
Description mentions something about bases, so first guess is to check if given string is something base64 encoded.

And yes, it is. 

Just run it through any online base64 decoder :)

Result is "l3arn_th3_r0p35" so i just have to put it in right flag format and challenge is done.

Flag:
>picoCTF{l3arn_th3_r0p35}
